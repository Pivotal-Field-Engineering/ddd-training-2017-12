# Contribution guidelines

Submit a pull request with your files. The root of your pull request should be
for a folder named after you or a handle associated with you (e.g. if you're
Alice Smith you might name the folder `asmith` or `alice`).

The folder should contain any DDD work you want to share, with one sub-folder
per complete project.
